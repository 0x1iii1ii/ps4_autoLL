# ps4_autoLL

**This repo is for users who want to enjoy the early HEN with Lua & Lapse. For the main update, please refer to the main repo [remote_lua_loader](https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader)**

Automatically loads HEN with Lua + Lapse kernel exploit for PS4, supports PS4 firmware up to version `12.02`.

Base on [remote_lua_loader](https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader) and [itsPLK's fork](https://github.com/itsPLK/ps5_lua_loader)

## How to use
* Copy all files from savedata dir to your decrypted save (make sure to delete all files except the "sce_sys" folder before copy), then encrypted and resign to your accounts (you can either use apollo and discord bot from HTOS)
* Copy modified save to your PS4
* Download vtx hen from [EchoStretch's releases](https://github.com/EchoStretch/ps4-hen-vtx/releases) or from [Al-Azif's releases](https://uploadnow.io/en/share?utm_source=CBpKbp1) and use one of the `.bin` match your PS4 version and rename to `payload.bin`
* Copy `payload.bin` to the root dir your USB drive (exFAT format) (it only needs to do once)
* Plug the USB drive to your PS4 and run the games, it will do the exploit and copy payload to internal HDD (it only needs to be copied once) enjoy! <be>

Please note that there might be bugs; this is an early version of the Lapse exploit, so keep it in mind. <be>
DO NOT run the exploit again after the HEN loaded, it may cause the instability. <be>
If you get exploit error, restart the PS4 and try again.

## Update HEN

* Copy the new HEN and rename to `payload.bin` to the USB drive's root, then run the game to update the payload on the internal HDD.
